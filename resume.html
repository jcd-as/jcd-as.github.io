<h3 id="engineering-manager-software-architect-at-bowers-wilkins">Engineering Manager, Software Architect at <em>Bowers &amp; Wilkins</em></h3>
<p><em>Menlo Park, Ca. 1/2016 - 12/2019</em></p>
<p>As a Software Architect and Engineering Manager for Bowers &amp; Wilkins, I designed, implemented and led teams responsible for frameworks and applications running on custom ARM-based, wireless-centric hardware products. These included a wirelessly mesh-networked video/HDMI-multiplexer with touchscreen remote control, and the Bowers &amp; Wilkins Formation® wireless speaker system (<em>www.bowerswilkins.com/formation</em>).</p>
<p>Achievements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Led the team responsible for the frameworks and application layer for the Formation® wireless speaker system.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented the software systems, frameworks, hardware abstraction layers and end-user application for a touchscreen remote control. This started with the creation of a custom Linux OS and included the entire software stack - hardware support (touchscreen, accelerometer, physical buttons, speaker, BLE, WiFi), OpenGL/graphics, host communication layer/protocol, porting of in-house libraries and the end-user on-screen application. The application stack was designed for maximal testability and could be completely tested using hardware abstractions prior to actual hardware availability. The final prototypes were fully functional prior to the cancellation of the product.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of my accomplishments at Bowers &amp; Wilkins were achieved while working remotely from Washington state. <br></p>

<h2 id="projects">PROJECTS</h2>
<p>Personal projects include:</p>
<p><strong>“Deva”</strong> - A complete multi-paradigm scripting language with C-like syntax. It includes a REPL-type shell environment, bytecode compiler and executor and a command-line debugger. It includes an extensive set of tests, utilizing a self-hosted test harness (i.e. written in ‘deva’). It consists of ~14,000 lines of C++ and is portable to Unix-like environments. (It has been tested on Mac OS X, Linux and under Cygwin on Microsoft Windows). The source code is available at <em>http://bitbucket.org/jcs/deva</em>.</p>
<p><strong>“Jaknife”</strong> - A software and hardware navigation system for yachts and sailing craft. Jaknife consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Jaknife server consists of a small stand-alone WiFi access point running custom software to multi-plex incoming hardware connections (marine devices connect via the NMEA0183 standard which utilizes two-wire serial connections) including GPS, AIS (vessel detection and identification), depth sounders, speedometer etc and send them out over WiFi to connected Jaknife clients.</li>
<li>The Jaknife client program runs on Android and iOS (with rudimentary PC and Mac versions) and talks to the server via WiFi. It loads and renders S-57 format vector nautical charts (an international standard) which have been converted into its own format (for load-time efficiency). It utilizes either the vessel’s GPS or, if that is unavailable, the mobile device’s GPS to track and display the vessels position and orientation. When connected to an AIS radio system it also renders the position and orientation of other AIS-equipped vessels. Objects on the charts (chart features, hazards to navigation etc) are both displayed on the chart and queryable for further information. The user interface of the Jaknife client is completely custom and supports pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan and a very easy-to-use but powerful command paradigm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have navigated thousands of miles using Jaknife as my means of charting and navigation. (Source code is not public, but is available on request).</p>
