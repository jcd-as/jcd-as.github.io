 <LI>The Jaknife server consists of a small stand-alone WiFi access point running custom software to multi-plex incoming hardware connections (marine devices connect via the NMEA0183 standard which utilizes two-wire serial connections) including GPS, AIS (vessel detection and identification), depth sounders, speedometer etc and send them out over WiFi to connected Jaknife clients.
 <LI>The Jaknife client program runs on Android and iOS (with rudimentary PC and Mac versions) and talks to the server via WiFi. It loads and renders S-57 format vector nautical charts (a "multi-govenment taskforce"-defined standard format used world-wide) which have been converted into its own format (for load-time efficiency).
